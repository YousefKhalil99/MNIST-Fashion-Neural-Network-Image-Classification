# MNIST-Fashion-Neural-Network-Image-Classification

For this problem, we will explore neural network models using the Fashion-MNIST data (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist).  

First, we need to preprocess the data by normalising the pixel values of grayscale images, e.g. rescale the pixel values from [0,255] to the range [0,1]. Then, we need to flatten the matrix into vector using the flatten function in numpy (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.flatten.html

We will implement the random forest model for benchmark purpose before building a dense neural network and comparing its accuracy to a convolutional neural network.
